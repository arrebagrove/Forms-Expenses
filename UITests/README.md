##MyExpenses Automated Xamarin.UITest and Xamarin Test Cloud
The testing suite in MyExpenses shows both a basic testing suite and a Page Object testing suite. There is a corresponding Xamarin Test Cloud application created for [iOS](https://testcloud.xamarin.com/app/3eec0344-6bc7-4bc0-a4ec-801aade5063f/), but the Android XTC is currently in development. 

[Extension Methods](https://github.com/michael-watson/MyExpenses/blob/master/UITests/ExtensionMethods.cs) are utilized in the application. It is a best practice to use extension methods like this. One of my favorites is [WaitForThenTap](https://github.com/michael-watson/MyExpenses/blob/master/UITests/ExtensionMethods.cs#L228). It will wait for the element to appear on the page, tap the element and then you can optionally take a screenshot by providing an additional string property. You never want to have a test fail because something hasn't loaded on the page yet and this can be a variable amount of time depending on your users current internet connection. 

Continuous Integration is setup through [BitRise](www.bitrise.io). All code commits will kick off testing suite on a subset of devices for iOS. Android integration will be coming shortly.
